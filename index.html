  <h2> Research Interests </h2>
<p align="justify">My research is currently focused on <em> Non-monotonic</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic"> Description Logics</a>.
More specifically we investigate circumscription-based non-monotonic extensions of DLs which have lower complexity (compared to existing approaches) 
and preserve usefulness for KR. 

The literature teems of non-monotonic extension of DLs, based on different approaches, 
too many to be listed here.
Circumscription can be thought as the <em> queen </em> of non-monotonic logics, as it can encode
large part of non-monotonic formalisms. Circumscribed DLs have been widely study, 
and a semantics based on circumscription
as been used for defeasible DLs. Circumscribed DLs are flexible and versatile, the price to pay for all power emerges
looking at the complexity of reasoning in different fragments. <br>

We are now focusing on a variant of circumscirption called <em> pointwise circumscription</em>. 
In its simplicity, pointwise circumscirbed DLs inherits a lot of power from (classically) circumscribed DLs. 
At the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first semantics for DLs based on pointwise circumscription. 
We proved that, the pointwise semantics produces decidable non-monotic extensions for fragments where
the classic circumscription leads to undecidability.
